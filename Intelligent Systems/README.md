The Perceptron folder contains the training of 5 datasets with the perceptron's algorithm, testing results, and comments.

farolas.CLP implements a rule-based system. It is represented by a robot, n streetlights (each one with 3 light bulbs) and a warehouse. 
The robot replaces the broken bulbs with new ones. Other files are variants or simple exercises.
