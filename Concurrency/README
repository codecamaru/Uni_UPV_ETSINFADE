Pool file represents a Swimming Pool where Kids and Instructors swim. I implemented Pool1, Pool2, Pool3 and Pool4 in order to match the constraints for each pool. 
In pool 0 everyone can swim. In pool 1, kids need at least 1 instructor in the pool while they are swimming. In pool 2, for each two Kids there is at least 1 instructor. 
In pool 3, the last constraints are needed plus there is a maximum capacity at the pool. In pool 4, if a instructor is waiting to rest, a kid cannot enter the pool if 
the last constraints are not satisfied.
